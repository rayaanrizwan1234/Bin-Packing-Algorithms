These are our programs that we developed in our research into potential benefits of using two stage algorithms in one dimensional bin packing problems. Each folder contains our Java implementations of different algorithms that find solutions to instances in terms of the number of bins it finds the problem to require
The classical folder contains FFD, BFD and WFD.

The advanced folder contains B2F, MFFD and MF_k (for k = 2)

The two-stage algorithms contains many different two-stage algorithms we've developed over the course of this project. 
> Please note that for these there is a level of inconsistency between the  two stage programs in regards to the orders of the parameters for functions.

All the substantial data we have gathered can be seen in the excel file.
For any questions or more information please email sc21rr@leeds.ac.uk and/or sc22kv@leeds.ac.uk , we have ended our section of research into this but are more than happy to help how we can.
